# SQLCovidProject

The project was about the coronavirus pandemic. The data used is given by 
https://ourworldindata.org/coronaviru
Following the route by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfyynHBFOsM&list=LL&index=31 
I constructed two tables, one with information about COVID-19 deaths and the other regarding COVID-19 vaccinations. After this, the query I did on PGadmin 4 was mostly on my own. 

The first step I took in this project was data cleaning, by obtaining the wanted data from the dataset shown above into Excel. 
Having difficulties importing the CSV file into PGadmin, I decided to cut the data from the dataset to just information related to the United States. After constructing two files in Excel one containing data on COVID-19 deaths and the other regarding COVID-19 vaccinations, and using tools to remove any data that could interrupt the importing process, I used slicers to then view the data types in each column to see if they were the same. After the data cleaning process, I imported the CSV files into PGadmin4 without any issues. 

After importing the data into the existing tables I constructed, I then began to contemplate the possible information that could be obtained using SQL statements that could show meaningful claims. The questions/topics that I formulated can be found in my SQL file.
